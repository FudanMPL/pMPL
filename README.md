# pMPL


## Introduction
pMPL is a three-party learning framework based on vector space secret sharing with the privileged setting where a party can be set as the privileged party before machine learning. Without the participation of it, assist parties have no chance to reveal the secret value even if they collude. Meanwhile, pMPL can tolerate either of assist parties dropping out during training.  pMPL supports linear regression, logistic regression and neural networks.

## Repository Structure
* '3PC/': The training process if no party drops out.

** 'Constant.h': All global parameters are restored here. 

* '2PC/': The training process if one assist party drops out.
